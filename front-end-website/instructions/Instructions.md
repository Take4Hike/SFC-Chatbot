## Project Overview

The goal is to develop a simple, intuitive web application that allows users to interact with a chatbot. The application will provide a seamless chat experience, enabling users to send messages and receive responses from the chatbot in real-time.

---

## Objectives

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Create an engaging and responsive UI that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Ensure messages are sent and received promptly with smooth scrolling.
- **Maintainable Codebase:** Structure the project for scalability and ease of maintenance.
- **Consistent Design:** Utilize Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components for a cohesive look and feel.

---

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** Shadcn UI
- **Icons:** Lucid Icons
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Build Tools:** PostCSS

---

## File Structure

A well-organized file structure is crucial for maintainability and scalability. Below is the proposed file structure tailored to the project's requirements:

├── README.md
├── app
│ ├── favicon.ico
│ ├── fonts/
│ ├── globals.css
│ ├── layout.tsx
│ └── page.tsx
├── components
│ ├── ChatInterface.tsx
│ └── MessageBubble.tsx
├── lib
│ └── utils.ts
├── public/
│ └── (static assets if any)
├── styles/
│ └── (additional styles if needed)
├── next-env.d.ts
├── next.config.mjs
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.mjs
├── tailwind.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json



### Breakdown of the File Structure

1. **Root Directory**
   - **README.md:** Documentation and project overview.
   - **package.json & package-lock.json:** Manage dependencies and scripts.
   - **next.config.mjs, tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.mjs, tsconfig.json:** Configuration files for Next.js, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and TypeScript.

2. **`app/` Directory**
   - **favicon.ico:** Favicon for the web app.
   - **fonts/:** Custom fonts used in the project.
   - **globals.css:** Global CSS styles, including Tailwind directives.
   - **layout.tsx:** Defines the overall layout of the application.
   - **page.tsx:** The main page where the chatbot interface resides.

3. **`components/` Directory**
   - **ChatInterface.tsx:** Encapsulates core functionalities (User Input Box, Send Button, Chat History Area).
   - **MessageBubble.tsx:** Reusable component to display individual messages with alignment, styling, and timestamps.

4. **`lib/` Directory**
   - **utils.ts:** Utility functions supporting components, such as formatting timestamps or handling API calls to the chatbot backend.

5. **`public/` Directory**
   - Stores any static assets like images or icons not covered by Lucid Icons.

6. **`styles/` Directory (Optional)**
   - Additional CSS or Tailwind CSS configurations beyond `globals.css`.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Input Box

**Description:** A text area where users can type their messages to the chatbot.

**Requirements:**

- **Placeholder Text:** "Type your message here..."
- **Auto-Expanding Height:** The text area should expand as the user types, up to a maximum of 5 lines.
- **Visual Focus State:** Clear and visually distinct focus state matching the overall design style.
- **Validation:** Prevent sending empty messages.

**Details:**

- **Behavior:**
  - The input box should start with a single line and expand vertically as the user types more lines, capping at 5 lines to maintain layout integrity.
  - When focused, the input box should have a distinct border or shadow to indicate active input.
  - Empty or whitespace-only messages should be blocked from being sent, possibly with a disabled send button when input is invalid.

### 2. Send Button

**Description:** A button that allows users to send their typed messages.

**Requirements:**

- **Icon:** Utilize a "send" icon from the Lucid Icons library.
- **Tooltip:** Display "Send Message" on hover.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapt the button size and placement for smaller screen sizes without losing functionality.

**Details:**

- **Behavior:**
  - The send button should be clearly identifiable with the send icon.
  - On hover, a tooltip with the text "Send Message" should appear to enhance usability.
  - On smaller screens, ensure the button remains accessible and does not overlap or obscure other elements.

### 3. Chat History Area

**Description:** A scrollable area that displays the conversation history between the user and the chatbot.

**Requirements:**

- **Display Format:**
  - **User Messages:** Align to the right.
  - **Chatbot Responses:** Align to the left.
  - **Timestamp:** Each message should include a timestamp in a smaller, muted font.
  - **Styling:** Different background colors or subtle shadows to differentiate user messages from chatbot responses.
- **Functionality:**
  - **Smooth Scrolling:** Automatically scroll to the latest message when a new one is added.
  - **Initial State:** Display a welcome message from the chatbot upon loading.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The application should load quickly and handle user interactions smoothly without noticeable lag.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the UI adapts seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility standards (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation) to make the app usable for all users.
- **Scalability:** Structure the codebase to accommodate future features or enhancements with minimal refactoring.
- **Security:** Implement best practices to secure user data and interactions, especially if integrating with backend services.

---

## Documentation and Examples

### Example User Interaction Flow

1. **Initial Load:**
   - The chat history area displays a welcome message from the chatbot:
     ```
     [Bot] Welcome! How can I assist you today? [10:00 AM]
     ```

2. **User Sends a Message:**
   - User types "Hello!" into the input box.
   - Upon clicking the send button, the message appears aligned to the right:
     ```
     [User] Hello! [10:01 AM]
     ```

3. **Chatbot Responds:**
   - After a short delay, the chatbot replies:
     ```
     [Bot] Hi there! How can I help you today? [10:01 AM]
     ```

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

- **Chatbot Backend:** A backend service or API exists or will be developed to handle chatbot responses.
- **Lucid Icons Availability:** The required "send" icon and other necessary icons are available in the Lucid Icons library.

### Constraints

- **Development Time:** The project aims to be simple and may not include advanced features like user authentication or persistent chat history.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Focus on modern browsers; older browser support is not prioritized.
